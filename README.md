## Usage Guide

### Dashboard Layout

1. **Dragging Widgets**

   - Click and hold the header (title bar) of any widget to drag it
   - Widgets can be repositioned anywhere on the dashboard
   - The layout automatically adjusts to prevent overlapping

2. **Resizing Widgets**
   - Hover over the edges or corners of any widget to see resize handles
   - Click and drag these handles to adjust the widget size
   - Widgets maintain their aspect ratio while resizing

### Market Overview Table

1. **Searching for Symbols**

   - Use the search bar in the Market Overview table
   - Type any symbol (e.g., "BTC", "ETH", "AAPL")
   - Results filter in real-time as you type

2. **Sorting and Filtering**
   - Click column headers to sort by that column
   - Use the filter icons in column headers for advanced filtering
   - Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously

### Price Oscillator

1. **Monitoring Specific Symbols**

   - Enter a symbol in the search input at the top of the Price Oscillator
   - The chart will update in real-time with price changes
   - The display shows:
     - Current price change percentage
     - Last price
     - Historical price changes (last 10 updates)

2. **Reading the Chart**
   - Green bars indicate positive price changes
   - Purple bars indicate negative price changes
   - Bar height represents the magnitude of change
   - Most recent changes are on the right
   - Older changes fade to show historical progression

### General Tips

- The dashboard is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile
- Widget positions and sizes are saved automatically
- Use the Live Indicator to confirm real-time data connection
- Hover over elements for additional information and tooltips
