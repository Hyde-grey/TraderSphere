## Usage Guide

### Symbol Selection and Dashboard Integration

**Important: To see live data across all widgets, you must first select a symbol from the Market Overview table.**

1. **Selecting a Trading Symbol**

   - Click on any row in the Market Overview table to select that symbol
   - Once selected, all dashboard widgets will update to display data for the chosen symbol
   - The selected symbol will be highlighted in the table
   - All connected widgets (Price Oscillator, Candlestick Chart, and News Feed) will automatically update to show relevant data

2. **Widget Synchronization**
   - All widgets are connected through a shared symbol context
   - Changing the symbol in one place updates all widgets
   - This provides a cohesive view of a single trading asset across different data visualizations

### Dashboard Layout

1. **Dragging Widgets**

   - Click and hold the header (title bar) of any widget to drag it
   - Widgets can be repositioned anywhere on the dashboard
   - The layout automatically adjusts to prevent overlapping

2. **Resizing Widgets**
   - Hover over the edges or corners of any widget to see resize handles
   - Click and drag these handles to adjust the widget size
   - Widgets maintain their aspect ratio while resizing

### Market Overview Table

1. **Searching for Symbols**

   - Use the search bar in the Market Overview table
   - Type any symbol (e.g., "BTC", "ETH", "AAPL")
